      In GoldRush you have two teams trying to collect gold as fast as they can. In the middle of the map zombie pigman will spawn.
      Kill them to get XP and their gold! Use the XP to buy stuff in the shop, and put the gold into the hopper at your base.
    - Another way of getting XP is standing near the XP towers. If you are in an enemies base you cannot hurt them, but they can hurt you!
